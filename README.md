- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Supermaxxcxx
I've started 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp training on 20-May-2024.
I've never been programming before.
I undertand that it will be challenging.
In this repository, I will show the different Python exercises I will be doing on the 100 Days of Code.
Day number 1
I have understand the only one function - and it is PRINT. :) 
Day number 2
i've modified a bit the execsise and insted of only weeks calculation the code now calculate the months as well

age = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52
month = years * 12
print(f"You have {weeks} weeks and {month} months left.")
