- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Supermaxxcxx
I've started 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp training on 20-May-2024.
I've never been programming before.
I undertand that it will be challenging.
In this repository, I will show the different Python exercises I will be doing on the 100 Days of Code.
